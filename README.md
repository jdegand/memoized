# Memoized

[Angular Challenges](https://github.com/tomalaforge/angular-challenges/commit/ea7eee2d4a2608e89529141403a0fce070f97b5c) #35 Memoization

## Thoughts

- I saw this added and starting working on before directions were included.
- Type one letter and there will be a few second re-run of the whole list.  
- I improved performance by using a memoized fibonacci function.
- The directions want challengers to use a pipe and not touch the fibonacci function.
- You could probably use a separate memo function but pipes are better and flexible than memo functions.
